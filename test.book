# Chapter 1

## 1

Jack woke up in his car. The sun had crept above the dash and was
blaring directly into his eyes. He squinted and grunted, holding
his hand up to blot it out.

"Ah fuck."

He pulled himself up by the steering wheel and snapped the seat
into place. It thumped against his back and rested on it. Jack
kept his hand over his eyes, pushing back the pain with his
eyelids as they adjusted. He rubbed his temples, his head was
pounding.

He mumbled under his breath.

"For fucks sake when is this gonna end."

He had been on the road for... How long had he been on the road?
Hell if he knew. [make 1st pov intern thought] The days had all
merged into one, day after day of mile after mile, this long
black asphalt vein sliding beneath his car for hours on end. He
couldn't wouldn't stop. Not until he felt that he was far enough
way. Not until he felt he was safe.

He didn't know where he'd end up, and it didn't matter. Anywhere
was fine. Anywhere he couldn't be found would be better.

*Far, far away is what I need.*

And he was heading there.

After some time, Jack got out of the car. The air was cool and
crisp, birds were chirping and the grass was damp with dew. He
had parked his small, black car on the side of a two-lane
highway. It was in the middle of nowhere, fields in every
direction. Jack walked around the car and to a glistening
barbwire fence. He stuck his hands in his pockets and looked out
across the field. The land was bumpy. It rose and fell in
hillocks as far as he could see, what he guessed was e couple of
miles, up until the field hit the treeline.

After a moment of stillness, and a look around to make sure he
was alone, he unzipped his jeans and pissed. The relief was good.
It wasn't often he felt relief. He twisted, stretched, and walked
back to the car. The sun was moving and he couldn't waste much
time.

In the passenger seat was an atlas Jack had picked up some days
(weeks?) ago. He'd stuck mainly to back roads, harder to be
found. He'd been using this atlas -- he picked it up at a gas
station -- because he had ditched his phone, threw it over a
bridge as he left town. Being found wasn't an option anymore, and
Jack was making sure of it. He laid the atlas open on the trunk
of the car and flipped to the last page he had been using. It was
a region with few main roads, far from any major cities. There
were a few small ones nearby with old southern names: Attica,
Leeville, River Bend. Nothing attractive to an outsider.

Jack had found himself on Old State Highway 331 in southwest
Alabama. Not a place he'd ever choose to be, but it's where he
is. Another day of driving and he'd be close enough to Mobile.
From there, well, he didn't quite know. Bigger cities wouldn't be
safe for long. They'd find him. But he could leave, get on a boat
and head out. So far, that's what he had for a plan.

Jack tossed the atlas back in the seat and got into the car. *Not
much farther to go*, he thought. He turned the key and started
the car. Music played from a local radio station and he put it in
drive, turning onto the highway and beginning his drive again.

*I fucking hate this driving*, he thought.

The sun had risen a considerable bit as Jack drove down the
highway. He had fiddled with the radio, but the radio stations
around here didn't have much to offer that he liked. So instead
he had turned it off and drove in silence. He was making good
time. Being so far out in the middle of nowhere -- *Middle of
buttfuck nowhere*, he thought -- he saw almost no-one on the
road, so it was pedal-to-the-medal for him. The car wound about
corners, dipping left and right as the land dipped and swayed.
Farm after farm passed him by, each one so much like the last
that he could only tell where one ended and the other began by
the spindly barbed fences separating them.

*God, what a depressing place.*

He passed a road splitting to the right. The sign read:

TO RIVER BEND 

*How about fuck you*

The car sped past and the sign danced in its gust.

Some ways up the road -- Jack couldn't tell how far -- were
lights flashing in the road.

"Oh fuck."

As he approached, Jack could make out a few cop cars and a fire
truck. In the middle of the road was a logging truck that had
toppled, its trunks spilled over and lying across the road and
shoulder to each side. It looked like a kid had thrown a tantrum,
throwing his logs [name of log toy?] all over the ground.

*Some massive kid*

A cop, wearing a brimmed hat, met Jack as he pulled up to the
wreck. "Good afternoon to ya, sir," he said. The man was
middle-age, perhaps pushing forty. He seemed tired with bags
under his eyes and a gait that was only practical, with no life.

"What happened here?"

"Oh, looks like a logging truck done tipped over. Yeah poor fella
hit a deer and jackknifed." The cop shook his head. "What a
shame. Say, you aren't heading that way, are ya?"

Jack sighed. "I am."

The cop bit his lip and sucked in air. "Yep, what I figured.
Well, I'd suggest you go on ahead and turn this little ol' car
around and high tail it to River Bend, cause this here ain't
gonna be picked up for a while. Unless you just like waiting."

*fuck fuck fuck*

"Ah shit. How long do you think this'll take?"

"Oh, I'd say about a few hours at least. Gotta wait for somethin
to come buy so we can pick up all the logs. Kinda hard to drive
over'em."

*No shit Sherlock*

"Goddamnit. Is this River..."

"River Bend," the officer corrected.

"...River Bend nearby?"

The cop laughed. "Sure, you had to've passed the sign on the way
here." The cop pointed behind the car, off into the distance.
"Only other major road for a bit. Just head back a ways and
follow the sign. That'll take ya to County Road Seventy Three.
And County Road Seventy Three will take you to Porterville, and
from there you just hang a left and you're back on this road,
though a bit further along."

Jack let out a hefty breath. *Just what I need, another goddamn
detour.* A detour meant more driving, on top of all the driving
he'd already done and would have to keep doing. There was at
least another day's worth of driving ahead of him, if he even did
want to end up in Mobile. There were other places he could go to
hide, to be safe, where they wouldn't be able to find him.

"Yeah, I'm sorry man, that's just the way it is."

Jack looked at the cop. "Thanks anyways, I suppose."

"No problem."

Jack backed the car and turned around. He sped off down the road,
retracing his steps. The office was in his rear view, watching
him leave.

*Fucking River Bend*, he thought. *Fucking log truck, fucking
detour, fucking fuck. Fuck everything.*

The sign for River Bend came up on Jack. He pulled up, turned,
and headed toward the town. By now the sun was getting a bit low,
too low for his liking.

*I should be much farther along. Now what?*

He mashed the gas, got the little car up to eighty. The engine
was loud now, the wind was rushing against the car. Jack had his
eyes fixed on the road, looking ahead. He followed the road as it
curved left to right, slowly twisting this way and that, like a
cobra entranced by a flute. [ugh]

*Fucking detour*, Jack thought. Why this fucking detour? He had
better things to do. He had much, much more important things to
do. If he stopped... If he stopped and they *found* him, well. He
didn't want to think about it.

He'd managed to get out, just in time. Jumped in his car, ditched
his phone, and took off down the highway heading south. Had they
found out yet? Most likely. They couldn't have not noticed yet,
no way. His presence would me missed, he knew that for sure.

If they found him? He didn't want to think of it. Jack'd seen
what they had done to others who ran. They were ruthless, killed
without mercy. Scalping, prying their nails. He's seen men dying,
bleeding, begging for their life. Chained to the floor of an
abandonded warehouse, there was no one to save them.

*Pick a god and choose wisely*

The phrase was etched in his mind. He'd heard it too many times.
He--

A bird, bright red, darted in front of the car. Jack hit the
brakes. The tires squeeled for a moment and he jerked forward.
Ahead, the road came to a sharp turn. Jack twisted the steering
wheel and the tires squeeled again. He lost control, the vehicles
lunging forward toward the upcoming shoulder. Jack braced.

When Jack woke up, he was upside down. he was hanging by his
seatbelt. The air was acrid and thick. His airbag had deployed
and was hanging limp, tufts of smoke swirling off of it. The only
sound he could hear was the ringing of his ears.

He looked around. The windows to the car were shattered and the
roof had caved in. Glass shards were everywhere, glinting in the
sunlight. The atlas was open next to his head on the roof of the
car.

*Fuuuuuuuuck*

Jack's head was pounding and he could start to hear the blood
rushing to his head. He fumbled around and found the latch to his
seatbelt, pressing against it. The lock disengaged, giving a
light click, though Jack couldn't hear it. He felt it. His body
hit the roof with a thud and he groaned. Jack twisted his legs
and body as he reoriented himself. His legs were free and he
stuck them out of the window, scooting out into the grass.

Jack pushed himself up, grunting as he did so. His chest and arms
were already beginning to feel sore.

*God, fuck fuck fuck!*

He felt around his body. Only a few minimal scratches and some
blood. Nothing bad, thankfully.

*Could have been worse*, he thought. *Could have been a lot
worse.*

His car, however, had not been spared. It was totaled. All the
windows had shattered. The body was nearly crushed. Headlights
still worked, but steam wafted from the engine bay.

*It's a goner. Fuck.*

Jack looked around, but there was no-one in sight. He sighed and
screamed.

"Fuck!"

He kicked at a loose piece of car and it rolled off into the
nearby treeline. He kicked the car, but it didn't do much to it.

*Why? Why the fuck? Fuck this.*

Jack pressed the palms of his hands against his eyes and groaned.
Then, he laughed.

*Yeah, yeah. This is karma.*

At first it was just a small giggle, but soon it grew until he
was crying. He sat on the ground and laughed. There wasn't much
else to do.

A few minutes later, Jack collected himself. He crawled in
through the back seat and grabbed a backpack that was resting on
the roof. He pulled it out, brushed off the glass, and opened it.
Inside were his clothes, money, and personal items. Travelling
light was the only way to travel fast.

Jack swung everything he had left around his shoulder and
adjusted the straps. He walked up to the road and looked back at
his car.

*Not much else left to do, I suppose.*

Jack looked either way down the road, but the road just stretched
on, empty. The car was beside him, steaming in hissing. He
stepped forward and began walking toward River Bend.

[I am not a huge fan of this chapter and it need a lot of extra
work, but it's done at least, I can say that much]

This is a test.  I like that.  I really do.  Makes delineating 
sentences that much easier.  One less button press and it's 
automatic.
